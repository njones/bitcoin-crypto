This is a modified ECDSA library for Google Go language.
It is based on original code created by The Go Authors, modified to handle Koblitz curves (such as secp256k1 that is commonly used by Bitcoin applications). The x509 support is currently much more limited.

	Code status:
-The code is a beta version, it should work correctly, but it has not yet been thoroughly tested.

	TODO:
-Add more test cases
-Verify library's proper functionality on sample curves
-Test library in an actual application
-Verify copyright notices and other comments in the code
